## Summary

We are going to implement a coherent multi-processor cache emulator, to
compare and contrast a snooping (MSI) cache coherence protocol with a
directory-based one.

***
## Background

In 15-213, we were required to write a cache simulator in *CacheLab*. This
simulator was very basic, and did not account for multi-core parallelism.
Cachemulator is a multi-processor version of this, with the goal of exhibiting
**simulated** empirical evidence of the performance of various coherence
protocols.

Cache coherence refers to the consistency of data in the same address, across
each processor's local cache. When a single address is shared by processors
and processors *A* and *B* are reading from it, if processor *C* wants to
write a new value into that address, the local copies in *A* and *B*'s caches
need to be updated. There are two main protocols that ensure this
invariant: *snooping* and *directory-based*.

The **snooping** protocol requires any processor that wants to interact with an
address to first broadcast *to all other processors*, the fact that it needs
to gain exclusive access to that address. The **directory-based** protocol
allows only the processors involved in the transaction to talk *directly* to
each other. Each protocol has its pros and cons; this is what we seek to
investigate with Cachemulator.
